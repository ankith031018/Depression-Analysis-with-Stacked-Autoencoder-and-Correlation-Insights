# Depression-Analysis-with-Stacked-Autoencoder-and-Correlation-Insights
A study examining elements that lead to student depression through correlation analysis and machine learning techniques. It utilizes a stacked autoencoder for feature extraction and logistic regression for classification to forecast depression levels. The initiative emphasizes data preprocessing, one-hot encoding, and utilizing deep learning for meaningful predictions.

a stacked auto-encoder allows us to use the lower level features of a Neural network used for a similar task
although using a Deeo-stacked auto-encoder would be better, but for a task that needs a simple DNN, even a stacked auto-encoder is an overkill.
